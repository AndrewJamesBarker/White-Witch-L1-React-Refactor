# White Witch â€“ Level 1 React Refactor

### Project Type: Personal Development Project

**Technologies Used:** React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Vite

---

## Overview

**White Witch** is a single-page, story-driven game created to deepen and showcase full-stack development skills using lightweight, modern tools. This refactored version emphasizes clean architecture, intuitive UI flow, secure authentication, and persistent game state handling.

The backend (built with **Node.js and Express**) and frontend (built with **React and Vite**) are deployed **separately** and configured to communicate securely. The system supports authenticated users via **email-based authentication**, with data stored in **MongoDB** to persist progress and inventory.

## My Role

This project was **independently developed**. I was responsible for:

* Building the full front-end architecture using **React**
* Designing and implementing user authentication, including **email registration**, **login**, and **CAPTCHA** protection
* Developing the backend using **Express** to handle secure API requests
* Connecting the backend to a **MongoDB database** for storing user data
* Creating a responsive and accessible UI using **vanilla CSS** and custom design
* Managing dynamic user interactions and animations without external libraries
* Structuring the app for scalability and ease of future updates

## Key Features

* **Single-page application** with real-time game state updates
* **Email-based authentication** with bot protection via CAPTCHA
* **MongoDB integration** for saving player progress, inventory, and life count
* **Seamless frontend-backend communication** via custom Express API
* **Responsive design** and handcrafted animations using raw DOM manipulation
* **Modular codebase** with a clean folder structure for maintainability

## Future Improvements

* Add new chapters and narrative progression beyond Level 1
* Enhance visual and audio elements for deeper immersion
* Introduce more advanced gameplay mechanics and user challenges
