# White Witch â€“ Level 1 React Refactor

**Project Type:** Personal Development Project  
**Technologies Used:** React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, MongoDB (backend), Vite

## Overview

White Witch is a single-page story-driven game designed to practice and showcase front-end and back-end development skills without heavy frameworks. This refactored version focuses on clean code structure, intuitive UI flow, secure authentication, and persistent game state management.

The goal of the project was to create a seamless, interactive experience while handling user authentication, dynamic UI updates, and backend communication efficiently.

## My Role

This project was independently developed.  
I was solely responsible for:

- Building the full front-end architecture using **React**.
- Designing and implementing **dynamic form validation** and **user authentication** (registration, login, CAPTCHA integration).
- Managing **persistent user data** using a **MongoDB** backend connection.
- Creating a **responsive and intuitive UI** using raw CSS and custom design elements.
- Handling **API requests** for user actions and progress tracking.
- Structuring the project for **scalability** and **future feature expansion**.

## Key Features

- **Single-page architecture** with dynamic game state management.
- **User authentication** with email validation and bot protection.
