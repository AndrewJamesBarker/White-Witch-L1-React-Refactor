        The proliferation of new plant life by a new solar life cycle has filled
        the planet with radical new chemical compounds, causing myriad mental
        and physical mutations. With the floods, Tundra's Plague compounds the
        tenuous living conditions, rendering many weak in mind and body and
        susceptible to psychic manipulation. Waring telepathic overlords across
        the globe vie for supremacy. One such leader, Therionarch, has conquered
        two other rival factions, amassing armies from the infected population
        and his newly formed, fractious alliance, 'The Dark Triad.'

      <p>
        Your name is Caballero. You are the leader of a ragtag group of men and women. You
        are bearded, dirty, long-haired, strong, and healthy. Born blind, after
        the great floods came, you developed an ability to see using prescience
        and ESP. You wear a black cloak, carry a leather side satchel, and arm yourself with a laser pistol.
        You are visited in a dream by a Siren. She promises to help
        you gain an equal footing against the telekinetic warlords and provide
        sanctuary for your people. In the dream, she beckons you to her cove,
        where she will guide you on your quest.
